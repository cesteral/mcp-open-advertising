 * block to admit, govern, and reconcile external write operations without
 * maintaining an out-of-band registry. See
 * `docs/plans/2026-05-13-mcp-server-write-contract-declaration.md` in
 * `cesteral-intelligence` for the full design.
 *
 * Discriminated by `kind`:
 * - `"write"` — governed mutation; carries `operation` and a `readPartner`
 *   pointer so consumers can capture pre/post snapshots.
 * - `"read"` — read partner exposed for governance discovery; no operation
 *   or readPartner. Cesteral consumers list these to verify a write tool's
 *   declared `readPartner.toolName` resolves to a real, contract-tagged tool.
